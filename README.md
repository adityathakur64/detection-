# Real-Time Human Body Parts Detection using OpenCV & MediaPipe

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a real-time human body parts detection system using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.  
The application captures live video from a webcam and detects key human body landmarks such as nose, hands, legs, and full body pose, displaying them with a skeletal overlay in real time.

This project demonstrates practical usage of computer vision,and real-time image processing.
